# üß∏Kindroid: Arduino Environment Monitorüß∏

## Overview

**Kindroid** is an innovative device crafted to improve the comfort of indoor spaces by providing real-time data on temperature, humidity, and time. Powered by Arduino, this compact system leverages a DHT11 sensor and a 16x2 LCD screen to offer vital environmental insights in homes, offices, and classrooms.


`‚ö†Ô∏èThis is the 1.0 release of Kindroid. As with any first release, there might be undiscovered bugs or areas for improvement. Users are encouraged to provide feedback and report any issues to help enhance future versions of the product.`


## Features

- **Digital Clock**: Displays the current time with AM/PM notation, efficiently built using Arduino's timing capabilities without the need for an RTC module.
- **Climate Monitoring**: Utilizes a DHT11 sensor to measure and display ambient temperature (¬∞C/¬∞F) and humidity levels (%), ensuring indoor conditions are optimal for comfort and health.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: A 16x2 LCD display presents all readings in an easy-to-read format, updating in real time for accuracy.

## How It Works

At the heart of Kindroid is an Arduino board, orchestrating the data collection from the DHT11 sensor and managing the display output on the LCD. Upon initialization, the device continuously cycles through displaying the current time and environmental readings, ensuring the user is always informed about the indoor climate and time.
